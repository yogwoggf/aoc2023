# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles in the most majestic language of all time, [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

## Usage

Puzzles are encoded into a simple format, `<day>P<part>`, e.g. `1P1` for day 1, part 1. To run a puzzle, use the `solve` mix task and provide the path to the puzzle input file:

```bash
mix solve 1P1 input/1P1.txt
```
